# DropdownMenu_Project_1
Building a dropdown menu. Diving into positions, display, z-index and finding an easy workflow

## Tuesday | 27-5-2025 | 20:06
Today I realised I have to dive into several subjects to be able to build a dropdown menu without getting stuck for hours...
### Subjects I need to understand better:
1. Position
2. Display
3. Top, Bottom, Left and Right
4. z-index
5. Order of elements (nav, div, ul, span, li, a)
6. Anatomy of  navigationbar and dropdown menu
